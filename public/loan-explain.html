          <p>
            Registration and authentication: Users must register an account on the crypto platform and undergo identity verification and KYC (Know Your Customer) processes as required by the platform.



<br><br>

Supported assets: The platform will clearly list the supported cryptocurrency assets and lending assets, and users can choose to provide collateral and lend lending assets.


<br><br>


Collateral and lending assets: Users can deposit specific cryptocurrency assets into the platform as collateral to lend specific lending assets.

<br><br>



Lending interest rate: The platform will publish lending interest rates, which are determined based on market supply and demand and the value of the collateral. The interest rate may be adjusted based on market fluctuations.


<br><br>


Lending term: Each lending transaction will set a fixed lending term, and users need to repay the lending assets and interest within a specific time.


<br><br>


Risk reminder: Lending transactions involve market risks, and users should clearly understand and be willing to bear these risks. The platform may provide relevant risk reminders and suggestions.


<br><br>


Collateral maintenance: In order to keep the lending transaction valid, users need to ensure that the value of the collateral is not less than a certain percentage (such as 120%) of the value of the lending assets. If the collateral value is lower than the maintenance ratio, the user may need to add collateral or repay part of the lending assets.

<br><br>

Collateral liquidation: If the value of the collateral drops severely and the maintenance ratio cannot be met, the platform has the right to liquidate the collateral without notice and use the liquidation proceeds to repay the loan assets.
<br><br>


Early repayment: Users have the right to repay the loan assets and interest in advance before the loan period expires. Early repayment may incur certain fees.

<br><br>

Platform fees: The platform will charge a certain percentage of the loan transaction fee to maintain the operation and services of the platform.
<br><br>


Loan contract: Lending transactions will be managed and executed through smart contracts on the crypto platform to ensure the transparency and security of transactions.

<br><br>


Legal compliance: Crypto platform lending transactions may be affected by local financial laws and regulations, and users should ensure compliance with local laws and regulations. Lending and repayment rules: Since our company strictly adopts the system of isolating and preserving user funds, the funds invested by users are separately kept in the international bank account of the financial center, which is isolated and distinguished from the funds of traders and our company's trading accounts. Therefore, borrowing users need to use funds outside the trading account to repay the loan, and cannot use the trading account funds to directly deduct the loan amount. This is the only way to ensure the safety of each investor's user funds and strictly prevent the exchange and user funds from being mixed. This rule is supervised and implemented by the US SEC regulatory agency and CFTC to enforce the highest security standards of financial law. Every investor must abide by this rule. If there is a breach of contract, legal liability such as legal proceedings will be borne!
