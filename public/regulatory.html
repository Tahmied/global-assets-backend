    </div>
    <div class="accordion-content">
  KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations are essential components of anti-money laundering (AML) compliance frameworks globally. In the U.S., KYC requirements are primarily governed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), as implemented and enforced by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). These regulations ensure that financial institutions verify and understand their customers to prevent financial crimes, such as money laundering, terrorist financing, and fraud.

  <br><br>

  Key Components of KYC Regulations

  <br>

  <ul>
    <li>
      1. Customer Identification Program (CIP):
      <ul>
        <li>• Financial institutions must implement a CIP to verify the identity of individuals or entities before opening an account.</li>
        <li>• Minimum information collected:
          <ul>
            <li>• Name</li>
            <li>• Date of birth (for individuals)</li>
            <li>• Address</li>
            <li>• Identification number (e.g., Social Security Number for U.S. residents or a Taxpayer Identification Number for non-residents).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>• Verification must include:
          <ul>
            <li>• Documentary methods (e.g., government-issued ID).</li>
            <li>• Non-documentary methods (e.g., credit reports or database checks).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      2. Customer Due Diligence (CDD):
      <ul>
        <li>• Institutions must gather information to assess and verify the customer’s risk profile and expected activity.</li>
        <li>• Key activities:
          <ul>
            <li>• Understand the purpose and nature of the customer relationship.</li>
            <li>• Identify the beneficial owners of legal entity customers.</li>
            <li>• Monitor transactions for consistency with the customer’s stated purposes.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      3. Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD):
      <ul>
        <li>• For high-risk customers, such as politically exposed persons (PEPs) or those in high-risk jurisdictions, additional verification and monitoring are required.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      4. Ongoing Monitoring and Updates:
      <ul>
        <li>• Institutions must continuously monitor customer activity and periodically update records to identify changes in risk.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      5. Recordkeeping Requirements:
      <ul>
        <li>• All collected KYC data must be retained for at least 5 years after the account is closed.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <br><br>

  Relevant Regulations and Guidelines

  <br><br>

  <ul>
    <li>• 31 CFR Part 1010 (General Provisions for Financial Institutions).</li>

    <li>• USA PATRIOT Act, Section 326: Requires financial institutions to establish and maintain CIPs.</li>
  </ul>

  <br>

  How to Implement KYC Compliance

  <br>

  <ul>
    <li>1. Use automated KYC solutions to verify identities efficiently.</li>
    <li>2. Conduct risk assessments based on customer profiles and activities.</li>
    <li>3. Establish policies and train employees to identify suspicious behavior.</li>
    <li>4. Regularly audit and update KYC processes to ensure compliance with evolving regulations.</li>
  </ul>

  <br><br>

  </ul>

  <br>

  2. Introduction

  <ul>
    <li>2.1 What is money laundering?

      <br><br>
      Money laundering is the process of hiding or disguising the source of illegally obtained "dirty" funds to make them appear legal and "clean". Money laundering reduces the risk of detection and seizure by authorities, and money laundering is as serious as the criminal activities behind it. Preventing money laundering helps reduce crime.
    </li>

    <li>2.2 What is terrorist financing?

      <br><br>
      Terrorist financing differs from money laundering in three main ways:
      <ul>
        <li>1) Its main purpose is to conceal the final use of funds, not the source of funds;</li>
        <li>2) It may involve relatively small amounts of funds, but may cause death, injury and other damage with greater impact;</li>
        <li>3) Although terrorists may finance their activities through crime, legitimate funds may also be diverted to finance terrorism.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>2.3 What is suspicion?

      <br><br>
      Money laundering and terrorist financing ("ML/TF") are sometimes discovered because of suspicious or suspicious behavior of members. In order for "suspicion" to be established, the website must have reasonable grounds to believe that money laundering and terrorist financing activities may be occurring. To support this, staff are trained to identify and report suspicious matters.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <br>

  3. The "Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering Policy" is as follows:

  <ul>
    <li>3.1 The "Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering Policy" is promulgated and updated from time to time to meet the standards stipulated by relevant laws and regulations.</li>

    <li>3.2 Some guiding principles and rules for the operation of this website are promulgated and updated, and the staff of this website will provide services in accordance with the guidance of these principles and rules.</li>

    <li>3.3 Design and improve the internal monitoring procedures for transactions, such as verifying identity through strict means and arranging the establishment of a professional team responsible for anti-money laundering work.</li>

    <li>3.4 Use risk prevention measures to conduct due diligence and continuous supervision of customers.</li>

    <li>3.5 Review and regularly check transactions that have occurred.</li>

    <li>3.6 Report suspicious transactions to the competent authorities.</li>

    <li>3.7 Identity documents and address proof documents will be kept for at least six years, and transaction record proof documents will be kept for at least three months. If they are submitted to the regulator, you will not receive a notification.</li>
  </ul>
